Short term goals
---------------------
Area lights

Features:
---------
Materials from json files? Or something I can get from substance.
Self intersection stuff http://pbrt.org/fp-error-section.pdf
Transmissive materials
Do something better than sloppy biasing to prevent self-intersection. Haven't seen much research on that but maybe bias based on cos(theta)?
Switch to a more complete BRDF (Disney?)
Debug tech (depth, material visualizations)

Optimizations:
--------------
Deferred path tracing
Russian Roulette ray termination
Texture cache
Texture layout swizzling

Engine:
-------
Ray tracer kernel context needs to be per thread. Then I can queue up subsequent rays rather than returning wi for evaluation.
Serialization system
Dependency system in Build
Error system
