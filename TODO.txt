Cleanup source

Features:
---------
Materials from json files? Or something I can get from substance.
Switch to a more complete BRDF (Disney?)
Transmissive materials
Vertex Connection and Merging
Depth of field

Debug tech (depth, material visualizations)


Optimizations:
--------------
Deferred path tracing
Russian Roulette path termination
Texture cache
Texture layout swizzling

Engine:
-------
Ray tracer kernel context needs to be per thread. Then I can queue up subsequent rays rather than returning wi for evaluation.
Serialization system
Dependency system in Build
Error system
