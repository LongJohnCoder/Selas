Short term goals
---------------------
Only calculate dndu, dndv when making a ray with differentials
Only call CalculateSurfaceDifferentials when using EWA filtering
Stop using shenanigans in place of actual tangent space stuff
Unify hit behavior between cast primary ray and cast incoherent ray

Features:
---------
Materials from json files? Or something I can get from substance.
Area lights
Self intersection stuff http://pbrt.org/fp-error-section.pdf
Transmissive materials
Do something better than sloppy biasing to prevent self-intersection. Haven't seen much research on that but maybe bias based on cos(theta)?
Switch to a more complete BRDF (Disney?)
Debug tech (depth, material visualizations)

Optimizations:
--------------
Deferred path tracing
Russian Roulette ray termination
Texture cache
Texture layout swizzling

Engine:
-------
Ray tracer kernel context needs to be per thread. Then I can queue up subsequent rays rather than returning wi for evaluation.
Serialization system
Dependency system in Build
Error system
